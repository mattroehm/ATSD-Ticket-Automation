This repository documents the design and implementation of an automated IT service ticketing solution developed as part of a senior-level information systems project at Appalachian State University. The project was created for App State Technology Services Desk (ATSD) with the goal of improving how IT support requests are captured, routed, and managed by automating ticket creation and workflow processes.

The solution integrates Cisco Webex Contact Center with Jira Service Management to automatically generate IT support tickets based on user interactions, reducing manual data entry and improving response efficiency. The project emphasizes system architecture, process automation, and data flow design rather than application source code, reflecting real-world enterprise environments where direct access to implementation code and APIs is restricted.

This repository includes the final project presentation and written report, which together outline the system architecture, workflow diagrams, integration logic, stakeholder analysis, and expected operational impact of the automation. The project demonstrates practical experience in enterprise IT service management, workflow automation, and translating business requirements into a scalable technical solution.
